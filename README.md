# MineSweeper
This assignment was made for the Programming Techniques - 2021-2022 lab. 
The goal was to learn how to use inheritance and dynamic method binding in a
more complex application.

## Description

The object of the game is to locate all the mines on a board with squares, as

mines are clicked open. During the game a timer (time elapsed) and the
number of flag count, and mine left are shown on the display.
