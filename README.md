# MineSweeper
Project done for the class of Programming techniques @ Group T - Faculty of Engineering Technology / academic year 2021-22. 
The goal was to learn how to use inheritance and dynamic method binding in a
more complex application.

## Description

The objective of the game is to locate all the mines on a board with squares, as
quickly as possible. The game is won when all the squares that are not
mines are clicked open and/or the tiles with bombs are flaged. During the game a timer (time elapsed) and the
number of flag count, and mine left are shown on the display.

The project uses a Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) That has been separated in three packages: 'model', 'view' and 'notifier'.
